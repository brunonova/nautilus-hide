First install the dependencies.
In Debian/Ubuntu, the (known) dependencies are:
- cmake
- python-nautilus

Then open a terminal in the project directory and run:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

Finally, restart Nautilus if it's running:
$ nautilus -q
Then start it again.
